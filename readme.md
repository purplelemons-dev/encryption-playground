# Encryption Playground

Right now, this project is a collection of scripts I wanted to try for fun. Inspiration comes from a cryptography class I am taking this semester (SP2023). Check out my [sha256-python](https://github.com/purplelemons-dev/sha256-python), a previous project that I've worked on.

## Requirements
`pip install rsa`
